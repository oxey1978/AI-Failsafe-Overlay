AI-Failsafe-Overlay

Structural failsafe protocol for AI misalignment recovery.

This repository contains a formal logic-based overlay designed to prevent and recover from misalignment events in advanced AI systems.  
It uses auditable structure, bounded operation gates, and non-emotional recursion filters to structurally suppress catastrophic failure modes.

## Key Concepts

- Structural misalignment filters
- Formal admission gating
- Persistence drift containment
- Audit-triggered lockout protocols
- Non-outcome-based recovery mapping

## Purpose

To provide a minimal, transparent protocol for verifying whether an AI system can:
- Recognize it is misaligned structurally (not emotionally),
- Fail safely,
- And enter a bounded audit state for correction or shutdown.
